## dplcoursera2015 exercise 1 in Exploratory Data Analysis

This assignment used data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>. In particular, the exercise concentrated on using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available.

For each plot the following was done:

* Constructed the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Named each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Created a separate R code file to generate each ploy

* Added the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

Assuming the R files and the txt file household_power_consumption.txt
are in the working directory of a R session then 
the four plots are plotted in R by using:
source("plot1.R")
source("plot2.R")
source("plot3.R")
source("plot4.R")
